<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/red-bellied-piranha">
    Red-bellied piranhas live in lakes and rivers in South America. They sometimes use their mighty mouths to gobble up other fish or animals such as shrimp, worms, and mollusks. <br>
    They swim and hunt in shoals, or schools, that can include more than a hundred individuals.<br>
    According to legend, the animals, which can grow about 14 inches long, have even devoured human swimmers.<br>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/amphibians/facts/american-bullfrog">
    The male bullfrog's call is deep and loud. Jug-o-rum, jug-o-rum, it calls. Some people think it sounds like a cow mooing, which is why the frog has "bull" in its name.<br>
    Bullfrogs eat all kinds of insects, mice, snakes, fish, and other small creatures. They hunt at night, waiting patiently until they see something pass by that they figure would make a good meal.<br>
    Bullfrogs like warm weather. When it turns cold, they dig down into mud to hibernate.<br>
