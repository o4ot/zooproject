<h1>Rainforest Habitat</h1>

<p>The tropical rainforest is a hot, moist biome where it rains all year long. Rainforests are Earth's oldest living ecosystems, with some surviving in their present form for at least 70 million years.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/orangutan">
    Though an adult male orangutan can weigh up to 220 pounds (100 kilograms)—females weigh about half what males do—orangutans spend most of their time up in the trees.<br>
    Equipped with very long, powerful arms and hook-shaped hands and feet, these apes climb and swing from tree to tree with ease. <br>
    If a baby following its mother reaches a gap between trees that is too wide for it to navigate, its mother makes a living bridge for the baby to scamper across.<br>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/binturong">
    Binturongs live in the rainforests of Southeast Asia. They belong to a family of carnivorous mammals that also includes civets. <br>
    The animals spend most of their time hanging out in the treetops. When they aren’t lounging on branches, they’re looking for yummy snacks such as insects, birds, and fruit.<br>
    The animal uses its tail—which is almost as long as its body—like a fifth limb as it climbs through the forest. This tail is prehensile, which means it’s capable of gripping things. <br>
    As they travel, binturongs rub a pungent substance produced in their scent glands onto branches and foliage. The animals use the odor to mark territory as well as to attract mates.<br>
