<p>An ocean habitat covers more than half of Earth's surface and these salty waters are a home to many creatures and plants.</p>
<h2>Mola</h2>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/mola">
    The mola has an unusual look. It's round. Its tail fin doesn't grow along with the rest of the fish after the mola hatches.<br>
    It remains short and rounded, adding to the fish's overall round shape.<br>
    The short fin is called a clavus. Molas use the clavus to steer as they swim.<br>
    Molas enjoy sunning themselves at the surface of the ocean. This is why they are also called sunfish.<br>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/fish/facts/great-white-shark">
    When a great white shark is born, along with up to a dozen siblings, it immediately swims away from its mother.<br>
    At birth a baby great white shark is already about 5 feet (1.5 meters) long; as it grows it may reach a length up to four times that.<br>
    The pup (which is what a baby shark is called) will live its life at the top of the ocean's food chain. As they grow, the sharksâ€™ favorite prey becomes sea mammals, especially sea lions and seals.<br>
    They can smell a single drop of blood from up to a third of a mile (0.53 kilometers) away.<br>
    Sharks don't chew their food; they rip off chunks of meat and swallow them whole. They can last a month or two without another big meal.<br>
