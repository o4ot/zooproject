<h1>Desert Habitat</h1>

<p>Deserts are very difficult to live in because they have extreme temperatures and months without rains.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/facts/deserttortoise">
    Desert tortoises live in the deserts of the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. During the summer, ground temperatures in parts of their range can hit 140˚F.<br>
    To beat the heat, desert tortoises use their strong forearms and tough nails to dig underground burrows where they can hide from the sun. Some of these tortoise tunnels are up to 32 feet in length.<br>
    And the burrows can get pretty crowded. As many as 25 desert tortoises might bunk together in one shelter. The animals also dig grooves into on the ground’s surface to catch rainwater.<br>
    After a storm, they’ll return to these holes to slurp up the water that’s collected inside. Once it’s had a good drink, a desert tortoise can go up to a year without requiring fresh water again.<br>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/fennec-fox">
    Fennec foxes are sometimes called "desert foxes" because they live in desert zones of North Africa and the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas. They are nocturnal and avoid the daytime heat of the desert environment.<br>
    Their batlike ears radiate body heat and help keep the foxes cool. They also have long, thick, soft fur coats with a wooly undercoat that insulates them during cold nights and protects them from the hot sun during the day.<br>
    These foxes dwell in small groups of up to ten individuals. Like dogs and other canids, male fennecs mark their territory with urine.
    They forage for plants but also eat rodents, eggs, reptiles, and insects.<br>
    Like most desert dwellers, the fennec fox has the ability to go for long periods without water.<br>
