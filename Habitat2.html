<h1>Mountain Habitat</h1>

<p>Living in mountain habitats may be hard due to the thinner air and cold weather.</p>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/mountain-gorilla">
    Mountain gorillas spend much of their time eating. Their food includes a variety of plants, along with a few insects and worms. At night the animals make a nest to sleep in.<br>
    Many lightweight gorillas nest in trees, making beds of bent branches. The heavier individuals may nest in grasses on the ground. Babies snuggle with their mothers for the night.<br>
    A typical group is led by the biggest and strongest mature male gorillaâ€”often the guy doing any chest pounding or charging. <br>
    He's called a silverback because the hair on a male's back turns from black to silvery gray as he matures. This happens when he is between 11 and 13 years old.<br>

<p>Here is a quote from National Geographic:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/mountain-lion">
    In North America, mountain lions eat mainly deer, but they also eat smaller animals, such as mice and rabbits. <br>
    These cats have a poor sense of smell, but have excellent vision and hearing that help them hunt in the early morning and evening hours. <br>
    Their powerful hind legs enable them to jump as far as 40 to 45 feet (12 to 13 meters). Females have an average of two to four cubs per litter and give birth in a den.<br>
    The cubs are born with spots, which usually disappear by the time they are roughly nine months old. Their eyes also change from blue to yellow by the time they reach 16 months old.<br>
    By 18 months, the young cats leave their mom to go fend for themselves.
